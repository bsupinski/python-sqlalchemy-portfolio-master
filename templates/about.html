      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        Rasied and currently living in the Oean State, Rhode Island. Been here all my life and yet somehow still dislike the ocean.
        Graduated with an associate's degree in Graphic Design, after finding out it was something I did not really enjoy, searched for another career to begion a journey with.

      <h2>Why Coding</h2>
      <p>
        Part of my degree program went over HTML and CSS, it didn't click with me at that point. I came across the TreeHouse Front End Tech degree and really started to enjoy it. I took other courses in JavaScript and really enjoyed that part of it the most. After practicing on my own I was a bit worried where as a Front End I may have to deal with layout and art mroe than I'd like.
        I really wanted to get my hand on more coding knowledge so started the Pyth Tech Degree and it quickly became my favorite. The need to solve problems with a limited resource has been enjoyable to me. There can be many ways to solve a problem, or just one. When you finally figure it out it is very rewarding.
